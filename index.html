    <p> My hobby is reading interesting and knowledge books in my free time. Whenever I go to home from my school I like to read such books after completing my home work. I am 10 years old and read in class 4th standard. Now I know very well that reading is very goog habit which can make me a complete. This hobby can be developed by anyone however I got this naturally. Reading books keep loyal, punctual and most importantly a successful person in the life.</p>
